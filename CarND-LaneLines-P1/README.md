## Overview

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

Using a Python code and OpenCV, we will be creating a software pipeline to process images to detect lane lines on roads roboustly. The same pipeline is used to process a video file (as video data is a series of images) resulting in a real time detection of road lane lines from an autonomous car camera's video stream.  

Detailed explaination of the code can be found in the [Writeup](https://github.com/AllenMendes/Finding-Lane-Lines-in-Image-and-Video/blob/master/CarND-LaneLines-P1/Writeup.md)
